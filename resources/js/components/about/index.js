                        <p>The name Bookworm was taken from the original name for New York international Airport, which was
                            renamed JFK in December 1963.</p>
                        <p>Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new location is 170 7th Avenue South,
                            at the corner of Perry Street.</p>
                        <p>From March 2008 through May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.</p>

                        <p>One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of

                        <p>We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook,
                            and our well-read, well-traveled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any
                            traveler, book lover, or gift giver.</p>
